# SQL_Java_Demo
A demonstration of mySQL integration with Java

*Upon first compilation of the program code, a process within the IDE removed all comments and replaced certain loops with label functions 151 and 159. After a few tweaks the program still runs as expected, though I am hesitant to completely undo the generated changes so as not to cause the program to fail. I have attempted to fill out the comments as they were before they were removed though due to time constraints, I am unable to fully fill them in as they were originally written.

The program was written to demonstrate: -
⦁	Initialization of standard format variables
⦁	Operations on variables of all standard types
⦁	Reading, writing and manipulation of simple texts files.
⦁	Extraction and parsing of information from text files.

The program stores user details in a text file called "Users.txt". These accounts can be accessed using the log in procedure and new accounts added using the register procedure. If a user is an admin, other accounts can be deleted. The next step in the development of this script is to add account detail updates from an admin account, with the frame for this process currently commented out towards the bottom of the script, as at this point it is not fully developed. The test account details can be found below:

Test account
Username: TestUser
Password: TestPW


Admin account
Username: TestAdmin
Password: AdminPW
